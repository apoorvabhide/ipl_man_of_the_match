This is intended as classification practice.
The basic problem I'm trying to solve is this:
  The match is done. Both innings are done, we know the result and how each batsman and bowler did.
  Based on that, can I predict who the man of the match is going to be?

Dataset is the IPL dataset on Kaggle. Data included is till 2017.
